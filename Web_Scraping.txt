Web Scraping in Python using Beautiful Soup module using Beautiful Soup and Requests module.

Web Scraping is the process of programmatically extracting some data from a website. In Python, we can easy write program to scrape website by using the Beautiful Soup and Requests module. Requests module can be used to access the desired website and Beautiful Soup module can be used to parse the HTML source code of the website. Beautiful soup makes it very easy to parse HTML content and then provides multiple methods which can be used to extract the data from any HTML tags. All the website are written in HTML language hence in order to perform web scrapping, our program needs to read the HTML content. This is were Beautiful Soup comes into picture to make it very easy to access the contents of HTML using very simple methods.

We don’t need to be an expert in HTML to learn python web scrapping. You just need to know the most basic HTML which is to know what is a tag and how to identify the attributes associated with a tag.
